### a vanilla nodejs script to state one of the most obvious facts of the universe

note: contains a lot of unnecessary lines of code for a really straightforward script
      because the goal was to keep the code organized and each portion seperate

    make sure you have node js installed in order to run the script
    download or clone the repo
    open your terminal
    browse to the root directory
    run the code by the command -> "node index"
